      "The booming rise of <b>large language models (LLMs)</b> such as ChatGPT has sparked a rush to produce discourse about these technologies. The quick crystallisation of a shared outlook around a few key themes has <b>narrowed the scope</b> of potential interrogations. Public and scientific debates focus on technical issues: algorithmic bias, confabulation, and intellectual property violations. However, the problems and consequences associated with their <b>actual use</b> â€“ for both their users and their professional contexts â€“ remain largely unexplored. This asymmetry fuels a <b>mechanical view</b> of technological development and its effects, as if the technical analysis of these systems were enough to predict their social impact. Moreover, these discourses present AI as a <b>monolithic and disruptive</b> entity, dismissing the possibility that it may be aligned with existing practices and that its effects may vary depending on situations encountered in one's job. There is thus an <b>urgent need</b> to move beyond predictions about the future of work, to account for the professional contexts in which LLMs are used, and to identify <b>current issues</b> â€“ not prospective ones.

Some exercises introduce <b>deliberate pauses</b> in professional routines, causing participants to take a <b>step back</b> from their own practices: during these pauses, judgment is suspended, giving users enough room to <b>question</b> their instinctive habits and feel unsure about what they once thought was certain. Other exercises aim to <b>intensify the use of LLMs</b> to shed light on what would otherwise remain too subtle to be perceived.<br><br><b>An ecological archive of practices:</b> The digital traces from LLM use serve as the <b>starting point</b> for the exercises we designed. They are <b>analysed, contextualised, and discussed</b> individually and collectively. Through this process, participants progressively build a <b>multimodal archive</b> (audio, photos, videos, drawings, and logbooks) that tangibly reflects their LLMs experience and how they are incorporated into various <b>professional norms</b> and material configurations.<br><br><b>A workbook (vademecum):</b> The workbook collects all the exercises and their instructions, organized into <b>thematic blocks</b>. Designed as a <b>modular object</b>, where pages can be added or removed as needed, it accompanies each participant throughout the protocol.
