The vademecum serves as both the \u003Cb>material support\u003C/b> for the protocol and the project's means of \u003Cb>dissemination\u003C/b>, as it can be reproduced and adapted in various academic and professional contexts.","#2C2C2C",{"Title":436,"Question":437,"Description":438,"IndexNum":78,"bgColor":439},"Contact","Our Team","\u003Cb>Donato Ricci\u003C/b>: \u003Ca href=\"https://medialab.sciencespo.fr/en/people/donato-ricci/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Principal Investigator, Designer\u003C/a> \u003Cbr> \u003Cb>Contact\u003C/b>: \u003Ca href=\"mailto:donato.ricci@sciencespo.fr\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">donato.ricci@sciencespo.fr\u003C/a>\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\u003Cb>Gabriel Alcaras\u003C/b>: \u003Ca href=\"https://medialab.sciencespo.fr/equipe/gabriel-alcaras/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Postdoctoral researcher, Sociologist\u003C/a> \u003Cbr> \u003Cb>Contact\u003C/b>: \u003Ca href=\"mailto:gabriel.alcaras@sciencespo.fr\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">gabriel.alcaras@sciencespo.fr\u003C/a>\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\u003Cb>Tommaso Prinetti\u003C/b>: \u003Ca href=\"https://medialab.sciencespo.fr/equipe/tommaso-prinetti/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Research Assistant, Designer\u003C/a> \u003Cbr> \u003Cb>Contact\u003C/b>: \u003Ca href=\"mailto:tommaso.prinetti@sciencespo.fr\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">tommaso.prinetti@sciencespo.fr\u003C/a>\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\u003Cb>Zoé de Vries\u003C/b>: \u003Ca href=\"https://medialab.sciencespo.fr/equipe/zoe-de-vries/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Research Assistant, Linguist\u003C/a> \u003Cbr> \u003Cb>Contact\u003C/b>: \u003Ca href=\"mailto:zoe.devries@sciencespo.fr\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">zoe.devries@sciencespo.fr\u003C/a>\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>","#3A3A3A",{"Title":441,"Question":442,"Description":443,"IndexNum":91,"bgColor":444},"Co-Inquirers","We would like to thank all co-inquirers who took part in our protocol.
